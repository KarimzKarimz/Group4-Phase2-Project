## Conclusion
### Summary of findings
- Genre Matters: Action, Adventure, and Animation consistently generate the highest box office revenues. Investing in these genres increases the probability of financial success.

- Timing is Critical: Movies released during the summer (Juneâ€“July) and the holiday season (Novemberâ€“December) tend to perform better, suggesting that strategic release timing can boost earnings.

- Quality Pays Off: Higher IMDB ratings are moderately correlated with higher box office grosses, meaning quality storytelling and production values still matter.

- Runtime Sweet Spot: Most successful movies have a runtime between 100â€“130 minutes â€” long enough to develop a story but not so long that it reduces audience interest.
